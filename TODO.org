* TODO Make the instance makers re-runnable
Detect whether there's already an instance for the type.
* TODO Make the 'derive all' function
* TODO Add any additional base types
* TODO Instances for tuples (use TH)
* TODO Produce external representations for things like Text/ByteString
In such a way that doesn't *depend* on Text/ByteString!
* TODO Implement Elisp for displaying a presentation
Maybe put it in its own package, not sure. It should be
self-contained, really.
